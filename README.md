To-be Moms need a forum where they can interact with other mothers and exchange experiences.
Every pregnant woman faces the risk of sudden, unpredictable complication that could end in death or injury to herself or to her infant.
Every mother wants her child to be healthy, but she is uncertain of what she should eat or do in terms of practices. 

<h1>Show-Stopper</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>User engagement</b>: Building and maintaining an active and engaged community of pregnant mothers can be challenging. Users may be hesitant to share personal information and experiences in a public forum, and may not be motivated to participate in discussions or activities. Creating a user-friendly and compelling user experience, providing valuable content, and fostering a sense of community can help overcome these challenges.</li>

<li><b>Legal and ethical considerations</b>: Similar to a pregnancy app, a pregnant mothers' community app must comply with various legal and ethical standards, such as HIPAA and data privacy laws, as it collects sensitive medical and personal information from users. This may require significant investment in legal consultation and compliance measures.</li>

<li><b>Moderation and safety</b>: Creating a safe and supportive environment for pregnant mothers requires active moderation to prevent harmful or inappropriate content and behavior. This may require a team of trained moderators, community guidelines, and a reporting system for users to flag issues.</li>

<li><b>Technical development</b>: Developing a robust and reliable app that can handle the dynamic needs of a community can be technically challenging. The app may need to support various communication and collaboration features, such as forums, chat rooms, and video conferencing. It also needs to be user-friendly, accessible, and secure.</li>

<li><b>Monetization</b>: Monetizing a pregnant mothers' community app can be challenging, as users may be reluctant to pay for a community app. Finding a sustainable revenue model, such as through advertising or partnerships with healthcare providers, may require significant market research and experimentation.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Utopia</h1>
<ul>
<li>Mothers who are expecting have a forum where they can share their pregnancy advice and learn from other mothers' experiences.</li>

<li>Mothers can obtain precise advice regarding the ideal nutrition for their newborns.</li>

<li>Mothers can be well aware of the health complications regarding pregnancy and accordingly take actions if required.</li>
</ul>
